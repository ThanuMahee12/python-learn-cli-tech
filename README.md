# Python Learn CLI Tech

Learn and explore different kinds of CLI tools in Python.

## Overview
This repository contains examples and notebooks to help you understand and experiment with various command-line interface (CLI) tools and libraries in Python.

## Structure
- `argparser/` — Examples using Python's built-in `argparse` module for CLI argument parsing.
    - `calculator.py` — Simple calculator CLI example.
    - `greeting.py` — Greeting CLI example.
- `Rich.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook demonstrating usage of the `rich` library for beautiful terminal output.
- `tqdm.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook demonstrating progress bars with `tqdm`.
- `Rich/` — Directory for Rich library experiments (e.g., `RichProgress.py`).

## Featured Libraries
- [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html): Standard library for parsing CLI arguments.
- [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/): For rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
- [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/): Fast, extensible progress bars for loops and CLI tasks.
